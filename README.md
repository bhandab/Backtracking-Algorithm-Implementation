# Backtracking-Algorithm-Implementation
Solved 3-in-a-row puzzle by utilizing backtracking algorithm. This program implement backtracking algorithm in such a way that  each row and column has equal number of blue and white squares, and no row or column has three of same color squares in sequence. It solves for any number of square boxes (e.g. 2*2,3*3,4*4, etc).
